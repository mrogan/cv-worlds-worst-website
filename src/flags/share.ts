/**
 * The share's signed ids: which of the factory's traffic generator's requests carry an id the shop may target by.
 *
 * The contract is the factory's (docs/COMPONENTS/FEATURE-FLAGS.md, "The share's signed ids", in
 * the-roganator/cv-software-factory): three headers, each sent once; the time in whole seconds, less than a minute old
 * and not from the future by the shop's own clock; and an Ed25519 signature over six length-prefixed fields, built from
 * the shop's own view of the request (its `Host`, method and request target), never from anything else it says about
 * itself. Anything else, and the request is not signed.
 *
 * The shop holds only the public key, in a file mounted from the cluster. With no file, or one it cannot read as an
 * Ed25519 public key, nothing is signed and the shop still serves. The id and its signature are a bearer credential
 * for one page and one minute: nothing here logs them, and nothing else may.
