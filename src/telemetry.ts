/**
 * OpenTelemetry for the shop: traces, metrics and logs, sent over OTLP to a collector.
 *
 * Preloaded with `node --import ./src/telemetry.ts`, so the instrumentation is in place before the server imports
 * the modules it patches. Configured by the standard OTEL_* environment variables; the endpoint defaults to
 * http://localhost:4318, and nothing breaks if no collector is listening there.
 *
 * Every signal carries the commit as `service.version`, so two versions running side by side can be told apart.
